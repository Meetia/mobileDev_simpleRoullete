Simple Roullete is a very simplified version of Roullete written with the intention to learn about activities, widgets, intents and UI design in android studio.
I have a better understanding of how components interact and tie into the code through the creation of this app. 

To use, launch the app with Android Studio on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and select the predicted outcome for the roll for each player. The app will then roll and output the results in a new screen.
